# 🚀 DSA Roadmap — What We're Actually Following

## Phase 0 — Repair Understanding

Goal: FIX intuition, not memorize crap.

- Learn reasoning behind patterns
- 1 **minimal** example per concept
- Done:
  - ✔ Hashmaps
  - ✔ Basic Sliding Window

---

## Phase 1 — Core Interview Patterns

Absolutely mandatory. No excuses.

### 1) Hashmaps

- Two Sum
- Frequency maps
- Missing elements
- Count-based tricks

### 2) Sliding Window

- Longest substring
- Max sum window
- Fixed vs dynamic windows

### 3) Binary Search (The REAL Version)

- On sorted array
- On feasibility / answer space
- On boundaries (first/last occurrence, etc.)

---

## Phase 2 — Expansion Patterns

After Phase 1, ONLY these matter.

### 4) Prefix + Suffix

- Prefix sums
- Subarray target detection
- Kadane’s Algorithm

### 5) Greedy

- Interval problems
- Scheduling
- Priority queues

### 6) Basic Graphs

- BFS / DFS
- Grid-based problems

## Note

We are **NOT** touching Tree DP / Advanced DP.  
Not needed for ML placements or FAANG-style coding rounds.
