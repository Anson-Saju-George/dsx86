# ⚔️ PHASE 2 — ARRAY POWER TOOLS + GREEDY

**Your Next Stage**

Phase 2 transforms you from “knows patterns” → “can solve real medium-level problems.”

This phase has **6 patterns**.

---

## 1️⃣ PREFIX SUM PATTERNS

You already touched some. Phase 2 covers all.

**Problems:**

- Subarray sum = K
- Count subarrays with sum K
- Longest subarray sum K
- Subarrays with sum 0
- Prefix hash tricks

This pattern appears in MANY hidden problems.

---

## 2️⃣ KADANE + VARIATIONS

You know the basic version. Now the real extensions.

**Problems:**

- Max subarray (classic)
- Max subarray with indices
- Max circular subarray
- Max subarray with constraints (easy variations)

This pattern is extremely common.

---

## 3️⃣ INTERVALS (Greedy Classics)

You already learned merge + activity selection; Phase 2 completes the toolbox.

**Problems:**

- Merge intervals
- Insert interval
- Minimum intervals to remove
- Meeting rooms I & II
- Overlapping intervals count

These appear in real job interviews constantly.

---

## 4️⃣ TWO POINTERS (Medium-Level)

Essential for SDE rounds.

**Problems:**

- 3Sum
- 3Sum closest
- Container with most water
- Trapping rain water (big one)
- Remove duplicates in-place
- Move zeros

---

## 5️⃣ MONOTONIC STACK (Light Intro Only)

No deep dive — just the ones that matter.

**Problems:**

- Next greater element
- Daily temperatures
- Stock span problem

A massive boost to your medium-problem range.

---

## 6️⃣ HEAP (Priority Queue Greedy)

**Problems:**

- K largest elements
- K closest elements
- Minimum rooms needed
- Merge k sorted lists
- Task scheduling (greedy + heap)
